# ChoritroAI
ChoritroAI is a simple but powerful tool designed for children to learn and practice Bangla letters. Using a whiteboard interface, kids can write Bangla characters, and our AI model — ChoritroAI, developed by our team Segfault — will recognize and identify the handwritten letter. It’s an engaging way to combine learning with technology!
